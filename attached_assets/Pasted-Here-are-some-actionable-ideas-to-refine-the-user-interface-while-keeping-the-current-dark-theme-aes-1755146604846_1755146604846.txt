Here are some actionable ideas to refine the user interface while keeping the current dark‑theme aesthetic and functionality in mind:
	1.	Guide users through resume analysis with a wizard or progress indicator.
The upload page currently presents the file upload and job description fields together ￼.  A two‑step wizard (e.g., “Upload resume” → “Enter job description” → “Review details”) with a progress bar would help users understand where they are in the process and prevent incomplete submissions.
	2.	Streamline candidate‑database filters.
The candidate database page has quick filters, a search‑type toggle and a lengthy set of form fields for internal/external search ￼ ￼.  Consider moving filters into a collapsible sidebar so users can open or hide advanced options as needed.  Autocomplete chips (like Select2) for skills, locations and certifications would also make entering filter values faster and reduce errors.
	3.	Use tabs instead of radio buttons for internal vs. external search.
Switching between your own database and external sources is currently done via radio buttons ￼.  Tabs labeled “My Candidates” and “Find New Candidates” would be more obvious.  Display only the relevant form for the active tab to avoid toggling sections with inline JavaScript.
	4.	Add loading states and feedback for long operations.
External searches and email processing can take several seconds.  Include spinners or skeleton cards in the results area while data is being fetched.  For uploads and email processing, show a progress bar and disable the submit button until the action completes.
	5.	Make candidate cards more visual and configurable.
On the upload page, strengths, risk/reward and job‑matching features are shown as simple cards ￼.  Apply the same card‑based design to the candidate list: display each candidate as a card with photo/initials, fit rating, key skills and action buttons.  Allow users to choose between card view and table view and select which columns/fields to display.
	6.	Enhance navigation and orientation.
The top navigation bar lists many pages (Dashboard, Upload, Candidates, Smart Search, Tasks, Analytics, Referrals, Pools, Sourcing, Email, Salesforce, History) ￼.  Too many items can overwhelm users, especially on mobile.  Group related features under dropdown menus (“Candidates,” “Sourcing,” “Integrations”) or use a sidebar for desktop and a hamburger menu for mobile.
	7.	Improve mobile responsiveness.
While Bootstrap’s grid system is used, some tables and forms may not scale well on small screens.  For example, the recent analyses table on the index page might be hard to read on a phone ￼.  Use responsive tables (e.g., converting rows to cards on smaller screens) and ensure all form inputs stack vertically on mobile.
	8.	Offer light/dark theme toggle and accessibility options.
The site defaults to a dark theme ￼.  Providing a theme switcher will make the app more comfortable for users who prefer light backgrounds.  Also ensure that colour contrasts meet WCAG guidelines and that all icons have aria-labels or tooltips.
	9.	Consolidate notifications and actions.
Flash messages appear at the top of every page ￼.  Consider adding a global notification centre where users can view recent successes, errors or reminders.  For actions like adding tags or updating status, use modal dialogs instead of full page reloads so users can quickly return to their previous context.
	10.	Visualise analytics.
The roadmap mentions an analytics dashboard.  Interactive charts (e.g., bar charts for fit‑rating distribution, pie charts for trade categories) and KPI cards summarising key metrics (total candidates, average fit score, referral conversion) would help recruiters quickly assess pipeline health.  Libraries like Chart.js or Plotly integrate well with Bootstrap and can be loaded on demand.

By focusing on workflow guidance, reducing clutter through collapsible panels and tabs, improving responsiveness and adding visual elements, you can make the TradesCompass UI more intuitive and efficient while retaining its robust functionality
